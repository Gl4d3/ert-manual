    </div>

    <p>The Meter Search section enables the user to search for a meter based on region, county and network type. The Network Meter Table contains all the network meters present in an area based on the criteria set in the Meter Search. The Meter Readings Table contains the readings of a selected meter from the list of meters in the Network Meter Table. Each record in the Meter Readings Table contains an edit button on the left under the ‘Edit’ column. This enables the user to edit the existing reading. </p>
    <p>On clicking the edit button, a modal appears as shown in the figure below. The modal has two tabs including Modification History and Edit Meter Reading. The Modification History tab contains a history of the modification of a meter reading. The Edit Meter Reading tab contains a form that allows the user to edit a meter reading.
