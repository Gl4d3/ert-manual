    <h1>Exceptional Report</h1>
    <p>The exceptional report contains a couple of reports important to ERT as their information affect the reports generated by the application. These reports include the following:</p>
    <ol> 
        <li>Meters on Feeders that are not in FDB</li>
        <li>Large Power Customers</li>
        <li>Elements on Unknown Location</li>
        <li>Feeders Without Meters</li>
    </ol>
    <p>On opening the window, a user is met by a dropdown in which they choose which report to generate. This is seen in Figure 4.25.</p>

    <h2>1. Meters on Feeders that are not in FDB</h2>

    </div>

    <h2>2. Large Power Customers</h2>
    <p>This reports contains a list of all the large power customers in KPLC. Large power customers consume more energy that the normal customer. In KPLC, the cumulative energy consumed by large power customers is over half the energy produced by KPLC. This means that a failure in billing of one or more of the customers results to great changes in the energy loss reports generated. The report appears as shown in the image below.</p>

    <p>The report window appears differently from other reports. It contains a month dropdown that allows the user to select the month for which they want to view the readings.</p>

    <h2>3. Elements on Unknown Location</h2>
    <p>This report contains a list of network elements whose location is not known. The network elements exist in the database but their location is not present. This report appears as shown in the image below.</p>

    <p>The pie chart legend in the interactive. On clicking on any of the items in the legend, you can remove it from the pie chart. This re-renders the pie chart to display without the selected element. The image below shows the pie chart with LV Circuit deselected.</p>
